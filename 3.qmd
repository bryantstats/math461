# Example 1

-   We would like to predict $admit$ given $gre$ and $gpa$

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#library(kableExtra)
library(jtools)
library(haven)
library(knitr)
mydata = read_dta('binary.dta')
mydata = mydata %>% select(-rank)
mydata = head(mydata, 10)
kable(mydata)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mylogit <- glm(admit ~ gre + gpa, data = mydata, family = "binomial")
mylogit
# 
```

# 

-   Can we use linear model here?

$$
admit = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot gre + \beta_2 \cdot gpa
$$

# 

-   Multiple Linear Regression cannot handle binary/categorical response

# 

-   Linear Model

$$
admit = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot gre + \beta_2 \cdot gpa
$$

-   Logistic Regression

$$
P(admit =1) = \frac{1}{1+exp\big(-\beta_0 - \beta_1\cdot gre - \beta_2 \cdot gpa \big)}
$$

# 

-   When fit the logistic regression on the data we obtain:

$$
P(admit =1) = \frac{1}{1+exp\big(-0.73 - 0.02     \cdot gre +3.57  \cdot gpa \big)}
$$

# 

-   For example, with a student having 380 GRE and 3.61 gpa, the model will predict

$$
P(admit = 1) = \frac{1}{1+exp\big(-0.73 - 0.02     \cdot 600 +3.57  \cdot 4.0 \big)} = 0.01
$$

-   This means that the chance of the student being admitted is 0.01 or the student will not be admitted by the model prediction.

# Logistic Regression

-   Suppose the response $y$ can only takes two values 0 and 1. The logistic regression models the probability of $y=1$ as follows. $$
    \pi = P(y=1) = \frac{1}{1+ exp\big(-\beta_0-\beta_1x_1-\beta_2x_2\big)}
    $$

or, equivalently $$
\ln\bigg(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\bigg) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2
$$

# Generalized Linear Model

-   The GLM models $\mu = E(y)$ as follows. $$
    g(\mu) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p = x'\beta 
    $$ where $y$ is assumed to follow an exponential distribution family.

-   Exponential distribution family includes all the basic distribution such as normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution...

-   $g(\mu)$ is called the canonical link function

-   For logistic regression, the link function is a logit function $$g(x) = \ln\bigg(\frac{x}{1-x}\bigg)$$

# Some GLMs

$$
    g(\mu) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1+...+\beta_px_p = x'\beta 
    $$

# Example 2

A statistician uses logistic regression to model a probability of success of a random variable. The estimated parameters for the intercepts and two predictors are $\hat{\beta}_0 = 0.02$, $\hat{\beta}_1 = -0.4$, and $\hat{\beta}_2 = 0.3$. Calculate the predicted probability of success at $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 1$.

# 

# Example 3

A statistician uses logistic regression to model a probability of success of a random variable. You are given

-   There is one predictors and an intercept in the model

-   The estimates of success at $x = 4$ and $x = 6$ are 0.8 and 0.9, respectively.

Calculate $\hat{\beta}_1$ the estimated slope of the model.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
-0.4359
```

# Example 4

You are given the following for a fitted GLM. Calculate the modeled probability of an Urban driver having an accident.

# 

# Odd of an event

-   The odds of an event A is the ratio of the probability that A occurs to the probability that A does not occur.

-   The odd of tossing an coin and see Tail is 1:1

-   The odd of rolling a die and see number 6 is $\frac{1/6}{5/6}$ = 1:5

# 

-   Logistic regression in terms of Odd

$$
\ln(\text{Odd of Success}) = \ln\bigg(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}\bigg) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2
$$

# Possion Regression and Other link functions

-   Poisson Regression are used when the response are count variables, for example: the number of claims of a customer...

-   The response is assume to follow a Poisson distribution and the link function used is a log link function, $ln$. $$
    \ln(\mu) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n
    $$
