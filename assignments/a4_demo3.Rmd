```{r}
d = read.csv('https://bryantstats.github.io/math461/assignments/HospitalCosts.csv')

# Calculate median charge
median_cost = median(d$TOTCHG)

# Create a column to compare the cost with median charge
# this column takes value 0 of the charge is less than the median and 1 otherwise


d$charge = ifelse(d$TOTCHG < median_cost, 0, 1)

# Train
model = glm(charge ~ AGE + LOS, 
            data = d,
            family = binomial(link = "logit"))
# Report model summary
summary(model)
