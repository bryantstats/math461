1.  Reproduce the results of the R codes in [the slides](https://bryantstats.github.io/math461/slides/7_h_clustering_with_R.html#1)

2.  Working with the [Maill Customers](Mall_Customers2.csv) dataset.

-   Apply Hierarchical clustering with the complete linkage. Plot the dendrogram.  

-   Plot the total sum squares within clusters and use the `elbow` method to decide the number of clusters.

-   Replot the dendrogram that with the clusters boxed 

-   Visualize the data using PCA colored by clusters.

3. Redo 2. with another linkage. 

4.  Perform Hierarchical clustering in SAS. Include screenshot of the result here. You can include a screenshot by putting the screenshot in the same folder as your Rmarkdown file and use (assuming screenshot.png is the name of the file):


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
