**Submission**: Submit the knitted Word document to Canvas.

1.  Reproduce the results of the R codes in [the slides](https://bryantstats.github.io/math461/slides/5_with_codes.html#1)

2.  Working with the [Maill Customers](Mall_Customers2.csv) dataset.

-   Plot the total sum squares within clusters and use the `elbow` method to decide the number of clusters.

-   Visualize the data with the selected number of clusters. Give your comments on the clustering results.

-   Visualize the data using PCA colored by clusters.

-   Report the cluster means

3.  Perform k-means clustering in SAS. Explain why the cluster means may be different. Include screenshot of the result here. You can include a screenshot by putting the screenshot in the same folder as your Rmarkdown file and use (assuming screenshot.png is the name of the file):

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
![](screenshot.png)
```
