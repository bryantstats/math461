This assignment will work with below NBA dataset.  This NBA dataset contains statistics for NBA games. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle. 

[Dataset](games_details2.csv)

## 1. PCA

- Apply PCA on the entire dataset (all variables). 

- How much variance are explained in the first two principal components?  

- How many principal components is enough to capture 50% the variance of the dataset?

## 2. PCR

Suppose we want to build a model to predict the points of a game (`PTS`) variable using Principal Component Regression.  Do the follows to compare the PCR and the regular regression model.

#### Regular regression Regression 

- Run a regression model on the dataset with the response `PTS` and the predictors being the remaining variables. Report the R-squared of the model. 

#### Principal Component Regression

- Apply the PCA on the predictors (all variables except the `PTS` variable)

- Run a regression with the response `PTS` and the predictors being the first five principal components. 

- Report the R-squared of the model.
